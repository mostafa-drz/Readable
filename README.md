# Readable

Readable is an web application designed in purpose of learning React and Redux. The main features of this application are Adding new posts in the pre defined categories, editing and deleting the posts and also put comment and edit and delete the comments as well. You can vote a post or comment in the application and all the posts are sorted based on their score by default.
